# 잘보이네 — Flutter senior launcher

## Environment

Remote sessions have no Flutter SDK. `.claude/hooks/session-start.sh` installs
the revision pinned in `.metadata` (currently 3.38.9 / Dart 3.10.8) and puts it
on `PATH`. It runs automatically at session start — roughly 1m30s cold, and it
skips the download when the SDK is already correct.

If `flutter` is somehow missing, run the hook by hand:

```bash
CLAUDE_CODE_REMOTE=true ./.claude/hooks/session-start.sh
```

Commands:

```bash
flutter analyze          # currently clean
flutter test             # currently 256 tests, all passing
```

The SDK unpacks as a root-owned git checkout, so `git config --global --add
safe.directory /opt/flutter` is required or every flutter command aborts on
dubious ownership. The hook already does this.

## Skills

The Superpowers skills library is vendored at `.claude/skills/` because
`/plugin install` cannot be run from a remote session. The plan documents in
`docs/superpowers/plans/` name `subagent-driven-development` and
`executing-plans` as the required sub-skills for implementing them
task-by-task.

## Where the project stands

`docs/claude-code/07_PHASE_PLAN_FOR_CLAUDE_CODE.md` is the phase plan, and it
asks that each phase be implemented, reviewed, and tested on its own rather
than all at once.

- **Phase 0 (project setup)** — done. Riverpod, go_router, feature-first layout.
- **Phase 1 (senior launcher)** — done, then reworked: the role-split screen was
  replaced by the splash in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-29-splash-and-guardian-entry-design.md`. The
  phone inside the illustration is the start control; there is no 시작하기
  button, and removing it again would undo a deliberate decision.
- **Phase 2 (local settings)** — done. Settings persist through
  `SharedPreferencesSeniorSettingsRepository`; 설정 → 앱 설정하기 reorders,
  renames, recolours and removes buttons, 글씨 크기 조절하기 picks the text size.
  Both homes draw from the saved list rather than the constant defaults.
- **Phase 3 (guardian dashboard)** — done. Built as mocked UI, then wired to
  the live data after Phase 4: 홈 화면 reads and writes the parent's `home_apps`
  rows, 홈 shows the real profile, the real active device and the settings the
  parent chose, and the parent switcher is real when more than one is linked.
  The mocked battery / ringer / network readings were **removed** rather than
  kept — they arrive with the Phase 6 background sync, and a plausible
  `배터리 72%` on a dashboard whose job is to reassure is worse than an empty
  state that says so. 돌봄 and the 4-digit code card are still Phase 5/6 shapes
  and are labelled 준비 중.
- **Phase 4 (Supabase)** — done. Schema, RLS and RPCs are applied to the live
  project; guardian email sign-in, senior profile creation, device registration
  and two-way home-app sync all work. See `## Supabase` below.
- **Launcher registration and app opening** — added after Phase 4, outside the
  numbered plan, which never assigned them a phase. The home buttons now open
  real apps and the app can become the phone's home screen. Native, and
  unverified from this environment — see `## The launcher half is native` below.
- **Phase 5 (pairing and recovery)** — done. Both paths from the plan, recovery,
  the free family invite and the primary-guardian handover, all applied to the
  live project and verified by `tool/verify_supabase_phase5.py`. The Phase 4
  `customer_code` path is superseded; the code direction is now the plan's —
  the parent's phone **shows** a 4-digit code and the guardian types it.
- **Phase 6 (paid features)** — done as far as it can be here. The subscription
  model, the consent flow, the refund-on-refusal state and the family-plan gate
  are applied to the live project and verified by
  `tool/verify_supabase_phase6.py`. The four capabilities themselves are
  **interfaces only**, which is what the phase plan asks for — see
  `## 가족 메시지 and its allowance

`supabase/migrations/20260801000000_phase7_messages.sql`. The PRD prices it at
월 50회 / 이미지 10개 free, unlimited with 안심 케어, and two decisions in the
counting are load-bearing:

- **The quota counts guardian messages only.** A senior replying to their child
  is never blocked, whatever the counter says — a launcher for an elderly
  person that refuses to let them answer their daughter because a monthly
  allowance ran out is selling the wrong thing, and the allowance exists to
  price the guardian's use.
- **The allowance is the family's, not each guardian's.** Two siblings share
  one, because the parent is the one reading them.

`ConversationView` draws both ends. One widget on purpose: it is the same
conversation, and two copies would drift. `large` is what differs — the
senior's is scaled up and hides the counter, because a tally of how many times
their family may write to them would be unkind and is not about them anyway.

On the senior's home, `04_SCREEN_SPEC`'s 가족 연결 또는 자녀 이름 버튼 is now
literal: before a family is attached it connects one, and afterwards it opens
the conversation.

## The paid features are interfaces` below.

All six numbered phases are now done. What is left is not a phase: a real
`applicationId`, an upload key, Play Billing, the native side of the four
watchers, 더 보기, the 메시지 탭, and a run on a real phone.

Route `/` is a launch gate, not a screen: a senior with a saved screen mode
lands on their home instead of the splash, because this app becomes the phone's
launcher and pressing Home must not show a splash. The guardian half now reads
the session Supabase restored from disk.

## Where the dashboard departs from the uploaded design

The design carried four things the project docs rule out, and the docs won.
Restoring any of them means changing the PRD first, not just the screen:

- 약 알림 / 복약 기록 — PRD Out Of MVP.
- 보이스피싱 의심 전화 — PRD excludes call-content analysis; the feature is
  scoped to numbers absent from the contact list and is named for that.
- 실시간 위치 추적 — `06_PERMISSION_AND_POLICY` forbids the phrasing, since how
  it is described is what the senior consents to.
- 여러 보호자 초대 — free in the PRD, paid in the design.

메시지 탭 is now built. An earlier note here said it had no design — that was
wrong: `04_SCREEN_SPEC` specifies it (카톡 스타일 대화, 텍스트 전송, 이미지 전송,
무료 잔여 횟수 표시, 유료 전환 안내) and `02_MVP_SCOPE` puts it in the MVP.
Everything but **image sending** is there; a picture needs an image picker and
file storage, neither of which can be built or verified here, so it is absent
rather than present-and-broken.

## Layout under large text

Raising the text size is the point of this app, so anything that only fits at
the default size is a bug. The app tile, the SOS pill and the pairing-code row
all scale down to fit rather than overflow — check new screens at 아주 크게.

`flutter test test/screenshots_test.dart` writes each screen to
`build/screenshots/`. There is no display here and no way to build an APK
(see below), so those PNGs are how layout gets reviewed.

## Supabase

Wired in as of Phase 4. `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` in the environment is now a
working Management API token (the earlier value was the dashboard's masked
display copied as text; that is fixed).

Project: `jal 26.07`, ref `jnmvhdmxzonngqyicelx`, ap-southeast-1, PostgreSQL 17.
`SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` holds the ref.

### Schema

`supabase/migrations/20260729000000_phase4_core.sql` is the whole Phase 4
schema and is already applied. Five tables — `guardian_accounts`,
`senior_profiles`, `senior_devices`, `guardian_senior_links`, `home_apps` — all
with RLS on, plus four RPCs (`ensure_guardian_account`, `create_senior_profile`,
`register_senior_device`, `replace_home_apps`). Phase 5 and Phase 6 tables are
deliberately absent.

Two deviations from `05_DATA_MODEL`, both load-bearing:

- `senior_devices.auth_user_id` — the senior is never asked to make an account,
  so their phone signs in **anonymously** and this column is what ties that
  anonymous user to the profile RLS lets it touch. Anonymous sign-ins are
  enabled on the project; turning them off breaks every senior device.
- `home_apps.client_id` — the launcher's own `LauncherApp.id`, so a rename or a
  recolour lands on the existing row instead of creating a second button.

`senior_profiles.screen_mode` and `font_size` are both nullable with no default.
Null means *nobody has chosen yet*: a guardian creates the profile before the
parent's phone connects, and defaulting `font_size` to `normal` would let that
silence shrink the text of a senior who had already set 아주 크게.

`tool/verify_supabase_phase4.py` walks the whole acceptance list against the
live project — sign-in, linking, device swap, both sync directions, and the RLS
denials — then deletes everything it made. Run it with
`SSL_CERT_FILE=/root/.ccr/ca-bundle.crt python3 tool/verify_supabase_phase4.py`;
without the CA bundle, and without a non-default `User-Agent`, the agent proxy
403s Python.

### Running the app against it

Nothing is committed. The keys arrive at build time:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://jnmvhdmxzonngqyicelx.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<publishable key>
```

**A build with no keys still runs.** `SupabaseConfig.isConfigured` is false, and
every repository provider resolves to its `InMemory…` twin instead. Phases 0-3
were built with no backend and `flutter test` has no keys, so that fallback is
load-bearing, not a convenience — don't make any screen require a live client.

### Pairing (Phase 5)

`supabase/migrations/20260730000000_phase5_pairing.sql` adds `pair_links` and
`senior_profiles.pending_primary_guardian_id`. Four modes share one table
because they are one idea — a short-lived secret granting exactly one
attachment — but redeeming always names the mode, so a family invite can never
be spent as a recovery.

Three things worth knowing before changing any of it:

- **The code direction is the plan's, not Phase 4's.** 경로 B is the parent's
  phone *showing* a 4-digit code that the guardian types. A code cannot carry a
  phone number, which is exactly why the guardian supplies the number and the
  name at that moment.
- **The parent's phone can create its own profile.** 경로 A rides on the Play
  install referrer, which only survives a store install, so 경로 B is the
  required fallback and has to work with no guardian present. `start_senior_pairing`
  is that path; removing it removes the fallback.
- **"연결됨" means a guardian is attached, not that a profile exists.** Showing a
  code creates the profile. Keying the senior's screen off the profile told
  them their family had arrived before anyone had typed the number.

Every invite carries both a token (the referrer) and a code (for when the
referrer did not survive). Expiries differ on purpose: 10 minutes for the
4-digit code, 24 hours for recovery, 7 days for a family invite, 14 days for an
install invite.

Moving the primary guardian is answered on the senior's own phone —
`PrimaryGuardianPrompt`, on both home screens. Not the requester, not the
current primary, not any guardian. Everyone else in the list is a guardian, so
nothing they agree among themselves establishes who should answer for the
senior.

### Guardian sign-in is email-only

Kakao and Google have no OAuth client configured on the project, and only the
repo owner can add one. `GuardianStartScreen` still leads with both buttons —
that is a deliberate design decision, see the spec — but with a project attached
they now open a sheet saying the provider is being prepared and offer the email
route at `/guardian-login`. With no project attached they open the dashboard as
they did in Phase 3. Email sign-up needs confirmation (`mailer_autoconfirm` is
false), so signing up returns no session and the screen says to check the inbox.

## 가족 메시지 and its allowance

`supabase/migrations/20260801000000_phase7_messages.sql`. The PRD prices it at
월 50회 / 이미지 10개 free, unlimited with 안심 케어, and two decisions in the
counting are load-bearing:

- **The quota counts guardian messages only.** A senior replying to their child
  is never blocked, whatever the counter says — a launcher for an elderly
  person that refuses to let them answer their daughter because a monthly
  allowance ran out is selling the wrong thing, and the allowance exists to
  price the guardian's use.
- **The allowance is the family's, not each guardian's.** Two siblings share
  one, because the parent is the one reading them.

`ConversationView` draws both ends. One widget on purpose: it is the same
conversation, and two copies would drift. `large` is what differs — the
senior's is scaled up and hides the counter, because a tally of how many times
their family may write to them would be unkind and is not about them anyway.

On the senior's home, `04_SCREEN_SPEC`'s 가족 연결 또는 자녀 이름 버튼 is now
literal: before a family is attached it connects one, and afterwards it opens
the conversation.

## The paid features are interfaces

`lib/features/care/data/care_interfaces.dart` declares four capabilities and
implements none of them. That is deliberate and it is what `07_PHASE_PLAN` asks
for — it lists a *location interface*, an *unknown-contact call alert
interface*, an *app install alert interface* and a *5-minute background sync
interface*, not the implementations. Each needs a system permission whose Play
policy has to be cleared first, and the only implementations today are
`Unimplemented…` classes that return nothing rather than plausible numbers, so a
screen wired to one has to render its empty state.

Three rules run through all of it, and none is a detail:

- **Paying does not turn 안심 케어 on.** `06_PERMISSION_AND_POLICY` puts the
  senior's agreement *after* the payment, so `pending_senior_consent` is a real
  state the guardian's screen explains rather than hides. `care_is_active`
  requires both halves and the consent half decides: a paid subscription with no
  consent must behave exactly like no subscription.
- **A refusal refunds, and is final.** It writes an alert telling the guardian
  the money came back and that the free features still work. It does not retry
  or nag, and it must not disable anything the senior was already using.
- **Location is 5분 주기 위치 확인, never tracking.** The class is called
  `PeriodicLocationCheck` for that reason: how the feature is described is what
  the senior consents to, so a `LiveLocationTracker` would make the consent
  screen a misrepresentation. There is a test asserting 실시간 and 추적 appear
  nowhere on that screen.

**No money moves.** Play Billing is native, needs a store listing, and cannot be
built or verified here. `start_care_subscription` is the seam where a verified
purchase token will be checked; everything downstream of it is real.

The family plan gates a *second parent* (`assert_can_add_senior`), which is not
the same thing as inviting a sibling to help with one parent — that stays free,
per the PRD, and both screens say so.

## The launcher half is native, and unverified here

`android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/example/app/MainActivity.kt` is the only
non-Flutter code in the project. It does two things: opens other apps, and
answers whether this app is the phone's home app.

**None of it has ever run.** There is no Android SDK and no `kotlinc` in this
environment, so the Kotlin is not compiled by `flutter analyze` and not covered
by `flutter test` — the Dart side is tested against `FakeAppLauncher`, which
proves the app asks for the right thing, not that the phone answers. Anything
touching that file needs a real build before it can be called working.

Three decisions in it are load-bearing:

- **The `HOME` + `DEFAULT` intent-filter is what makes this a launcher.**
  Without it the phone never offers the app in its home-app chooser. It comes
  with `launchMode="singleTask"` and `stateNotNeeded="true"`, which launchers
  need so pressing Home brings the running task forward instead of stacking a
  second copy.
- **Pressing Home is delivered through `onNewIntent`, not a restart.** The
  activity is already running, so the HOME intent arrives as a new intent and
  is forwarded to Dart as `goHome`; `HomeKeyListener` sends the router back to
  `/`. Without it the home key does nothing whenever the senior is anywhere but
  the home screen — which is exactly when they reach for it.
- **The `<queries>` block is not boilerplate.** On Android 11+ an app cannot
  see another app it has not declared, so removing an entry does not degrade a
  home button, it makes it fail silently. Adding a new button category means
  adding its intent there too.

System apps (전화, 문자, 사진, 앨범) are opened by intent category so each phone
uses the apps its owner already has. Only 카카오톡 and 유튜브 are named by
package, because Android has no category for them. 전화 resolves to
`ACTION_DIAL` and never `ACTION_CALL` — `06_PERMISSION_AND_POLICY` requires the
user press call themselves, and that holds for the 전화 button exactly as it
does for SOS.

## No APK from this environment — build it in CI

`dl.google.com` is blocked by egress policy, which rules out both the Android
SDK and the Android Gradle Plugin. Don't spend time installing either.

`.github/workflows/android.yml` builds the APK on GitHub's runners on every
push, and uploads it as a run artifact along with the review screenshots. That
is the only place the Kotlin is ever compiled, and the only way to get the app
onto a real phone from here.

Two things about it:

- The `apk` job deliberately does **not** depend on the `check` job. The first
  question the workflow answers is whether the native half compiles at all, and
  a failing Dart test must not withhold that answer.
- The APK is signed with the **debug** key, because
  `android/app/build.gradle.kts` still points the release build type at
  `signingConfigs.debug`. It sideloads fine and is enough to test on a phone. It
  is not a store build — a real upload key, and an `applicationId` that is not
  `com.example.app`, are both still to do.

The `check` job fetches `test/fonts/NotoSansKR.ttf` the same way the
SessionStart hook does, because the font is gitignored (10 MB) and without it
`screenshots_test.dart` skips itself — the PNGs would be all tofu. That skip is
also what a fresh clone gets, rather than eight failures inside `setUpAll`.

`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are optional repository secrets. Unset,
the APK still builds and runs on the in-memory repositories; sign-in, linking
and syncing simply do not reach a server. The run summary says which of the two
you got.

## Conventions

- Tests come before implementation — see `.claude/skills/test-driven-development`.
- Never claim work passes without running the command and reading the output.
- Work on the branch assigned for the session; don't push to `main` directly.
